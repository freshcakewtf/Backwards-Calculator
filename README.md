# Backwards Calculator

Welcome to the Backwards Calculator, where we start with the answer and work our way to the question! ðŸ”„

## What is this?
This is a fun, quirky project that flips the script on traditional calculators. Instead of giving you the answer, you give it the answer, and it provides a possible question. It's a calculator that's gone rogue for your entertainment!

## Why?
Because why not? Life's too short for serious calculators. Let's have some fun and see the world from the endpoint backwards.

## How to Use
1. Think of a number (that's your answer).
2. Enter it into the Backwards Calculator.
3. Get a random mathematical operation that could lead to your number.
4. Scratch your head, laugh, or both!

## Disclaimer
This project is intended for fun and might not solve your actual math problems. But it will definitely give you a good chuckle!

Enjoy the absurdity of mathematics with the Backwards Calculator!
